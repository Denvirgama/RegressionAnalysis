Facebook metrics Data Set
Our data comes from an anonymous cosmetics brand's Facebook page, which collects every social media performance metric specified for this Facebook page. It includes seven features known before post-publication and 12 features for evaluating post impact.
 
Problem Description:
Understanding your customer base is one of the critical steps to business success, even on social media platforms. In marketing analysis, you hear performance metrics like Impression, Engagement, and Reach Etc., these metrics help us draw a precise strategy for social media and marketing. Also, these metrics will help to predict social media's impact on brand building.
 
As the result of this, the problem statement here is to find a relationship of all affecting variables on the Engagement (LifeTime Post Consumer) for a post made by a user, implementing a model that predicts the impact of posts using their characteristics to decide on publishing it on Social Media (in this case Facebook).
